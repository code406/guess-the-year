# guess-the-year

This project is a clone of David Han's
[Guess the Year game](https://guess-the-year.davjhan.com/)
that I'm building for fun, to learn and use various technologies.

The app is currently deployed at https://guesstheyear.vercel.app.

I'm using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
(with Typescript) as the app framework, and
[Pico CSS](https://v2.picocss.com/docs) + 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles.
Icons are from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) and the font is
[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik), from Google Fonts.

If you want to run the app locally, clone the repo and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
